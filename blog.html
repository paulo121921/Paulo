        <h1>Understanding Cyber Threats: Viruses, Malware, Spam, and Antiviruses</h1>
        <p>The digital age has brought unparalleled convenience and connectivity, but it has also introduced various cyber threats. This blog will explore some common threats, including viruses, malware, and spam, and discuss the role of antiviruses in safeguarding our digital lives.</p>

            <h2>What Are Viruses?</h2>
            <p>A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to replicate itself and spread from one device to another. Viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs or files and can corrupt, delete, or steal data. They can enter systems through infected emails, downloads, or USB drives.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples of Viruses:</strong> Melissa, ILOVEYOU, and the Conficker Worm.</p>

            <p><strong>Malware</strong> is a broad term encompassing any software designed to harm or exploit devices, networks, or data. It includes viruses, ransomware, spyware, and more.</p>
            <p>Cybercriminals use malware to steal sensitive information, spy on users, or disrupt operations.</p>

            <p>Spam refers to unsolicited and irrelevant messages sent over the internet, often in bulk. While most spam is harmless and simply annoying, some can carry phishing attempts or malicious links that compromise your system or steal personal information.</p>
            <p>Using a good spam filter can help reduce the risk.</p>
