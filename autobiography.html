            <h2>My Autobiography</h2></h2>
          
    
    <p>My name is Paulo Endaya and proud to introduce myself as one of the most handsome and charismatic student in our field. Born on December 26, 2004, Currently pursuing criminology at Sorsogon College of Criminology, Inc. Aspiring to be BFP in the future. Only child of my parents, life as an only child has been unique but at the same time boring, living with my father. We The live at Panganiban, Gubat, Sorsogon. Growing up, it was my dream to study and become a BFP. Started my educational journey at the age of five, attended elementary at Gubat North Central School, and attended High school at Gubat National Highschool with a strand of General Academic Strand (GAS ) in Senior High School, and currently in SCCI for college. My hobbies are cooking, playing basketball, drinking, playing online games, and watching anime. It makes me calm and happy, when doing those thing. Loves to hang out with my friends because they make me happy and makes me laugh. My favorite dishes includes Adobo, sinigang, menudo, and bopis. My favorite color is blue, Music plays an important role in creating a sense of calm and motivation, So my favorite international artist is Bruno Mars, my favorite song of him is grenade, listening to his songs makes me feel at ease. And my favorite local artist is Michael Pangilinan, my favorite song of him is kahit kailangan. It provides me comfort and relaxation. My favorite place to go is in the sea, because whenever the wind at the sea touches my skin it makes me feel relaxed and at peace. And at the house of my friends because whenever hanging out with them it makes me happy and lighten up my mood. My dream of joining the Bureau of Fire Protection are fueled by a desire to make a difference in the community. The role of a firefighter represents more than just a career it embodies a commitment to courage, selflessness, and service. This dream has been nurtured since my childhood, and every step, from education to personal development, is aimed for achieving this goal. The journey has not been without its difficulties, but each challenge has served as a stepping stone toward success. Resilience, determination, and hard work have been the cornerstones of this path. The support of my family and friends continues to be a my source of strength, providing encouragement to keep me moving forward. Even when the journey is hard to push. Determination and perseverance have been key to overcoming challenges while staying focused on personal goals. With hard work and support from loved ones, becoming a member of the Bureau of Fire Protection remains the ultimate aspiration</p>
